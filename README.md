#Jebs Toolbox
A part finder for the vehicle assembly building in Kerbal Space Program!

## What does it do?
It make's it really easy to find parts, really useful if you have a ton of mods. Jebs Toolbox is a super simple full text search tool for the vab and space plane hanger that let's you search on any text field in the part description/resources/name/author/manufactor.

## Installation
Like any plugin for KSP just drag and drop [../part-search/bin/plugins/Jebs-Toolbox.dll][Jebs-Toolbox.dll] into your ksp/plugin directory.

## Can I contribute?
Of course! Just file an issue first and when you're done reference it in a pull request.
